<p>Takes a JSON document and a value and adds the value into the doc at the position pointed to. If the position pointed to is in an array then the existing element at that position (if any) and all that follow it have there position incremented to make room. It is an error to add to a parent object that doesn&#8217;t exist or to try to replace an existing value in an object.</p>

<p>* document - The document to operate against. May be mutated. * value - The value to insert at the position pointed to</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>javascript
var doc = new JSONPointer(&quot;/obj/new&quot;).add({obj:   {old:&quot;hello&quot;}},&quot;world&quot;);
// doc now equals {obj: {old: &quot;hello&quot;, new: &quot;world&quot;}}</code></pre>

<p>Returns the updated doc (the value passed in may also have been mutated)</p>
