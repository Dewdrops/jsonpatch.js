An implementation of the JSONPatch and JSONPointer IETF drafts.

A Dharmafly project written by Thomas Parslow <tom@almostobsolete.net> and released with the kind permission of NetDev.

Dharmafly is currently working to create a collaboration web app for NetDev that comprises a Node.js RESTful API on the back-end and an HTML5 Backbone.js application on the front. The JSON Patch library was created as an essential part of the RESTful API, and has been subsequently open sourced for the community with NetDev's permission.
