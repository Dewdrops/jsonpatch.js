Origin of the project?
---------------------

[Dharmafly][#dharmafly] is currently working to create a collaboration web app for [NetDev][#netdev] that comprises a [Node.js][#nodejs] RESTful API on the back-end and an HTML5 [Backbone.js][#backbone] application on the front. The JSON Patch library was created as an essential part of the RESTful API, and has been subsequently open sourced for the community with NetDev's permission.
